I'm a Ph.D student in linguistics at the University of Washington.
My research interests are mainly in phonetics and sociolinguistics, and how we can use what we know from both of these fields to improve second language teaching and learning.
I was previously a lecturer in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures at National Taiwan University in Taipei.
This work investigates how second language Mandarin Chinese speakers of different ethnicities are perceived.
